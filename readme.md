A port of decade old Java app I wrote back in the day to ease my suffering. Browsers and plugins have probably caught up by now, but I feel all strange when I press Alt+Space and it doesn't appear!

Typically I have the app appear as 300px wide sidebar, however settings to do this are not part of the repo and must be done via console profiles (linux) or console shortcuts (windows). I suggest doing it in concert with you hotkey program of choice.
